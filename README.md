## Purpose
A website that provides Spotify playlists based on your daily Horoscope results. User inputs their birth month and date then presses "Get sounds". After submitting their birthday, they will see outputs based on their horoscope. They will get a link to a Spotify playlist based on their daily horoscope and can choose to search again for a different playlist. Additionally, they will see their lucky number, color and mood of the day. The app stores previously search birthdays in local storage case the user would like to come back every day!
